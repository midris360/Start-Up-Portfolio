  <!-- paragraph with pseudo class -->
    <p class="pseudo">Katz, is a nickname that my friends gave me which is short for Katzeem, my middle name. I was always into web development, I found out around the Myspace days when Myspace became big on the seen as the number one social media platform. At that time I was putting my music on my own Myspace page and wanting to make my page look musically inclined, graphically.</p>

<!-- paragraph with an unordered list -->
    <p>Also, outside of web development, My hobbies are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basketball</li>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>Video Games</li>
     </ul>

<!-- two more paragraphs with the first being a pseudo class and the second ending with closed article tag -->
    <p class="pseudo">Being at Thinkful has made me feel more of what I needed to do when signing up and going through the modules and checkpoints. This is something I've been wanting to do as a career and now I'm finally doing it.</p>

    <p class="pseudo">If you're in need of a web developer and/or maybe even a Hack-a-thon which will be fun to work with others.</p>
